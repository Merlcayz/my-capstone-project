## My process
I downloaded the starter package and went through the instructions to familiarize with what I was up against.

I looked for resources to help me and Kimdoescode really helped me.

With proper guidance I completed the codes

My biggest challenge was deploying the code to Github pages.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Never under estimate the time it will take to complete a challenge:
I learnt that it always takes longer than you predict, so start out at once.

### Continued development

I need to improve on my media queries.

### Useful resources

- [KimDoesCode](https://youtu.be/O4sZf9wG_RE?si=yxOeaKzBOSqhIaAW) - This helped me to understand the full scope of the work required from me.

My sincere appreciation goes to the entire lassod learning team. Our exceptional tutor Mr Lordson Ajaititon did a great work taking most of us from literally 0 literacy in coding to moderately literate web developers.
